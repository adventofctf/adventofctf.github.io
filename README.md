# The Advent of CTF

The Advent of CTF is a yearly CTF competition held in December.

It features 24 challenges that range from easy to hard.

The competition is created and curated by [Arjen Wiersma](https://www.arjenwiersma.nl). Most challenges are original works, some other challenges were based on challenges seen in other CTF challenges that highlighted extraordinary fun and challenging topics.

## Edition 2020

The first edition was in 2020. During December about 500 participants solved 24 web challenges. The top 20 finishers received a Challenge Coin and the top 3 received additional prices from [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu).

The challenges are archived on github:
